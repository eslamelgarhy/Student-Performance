# Student Performance Data Analysis with Excel

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of student performance to gain insights into academic achievements and trends. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, focusing on data cleaning, outlier detection, and the creation of a comprehensive dashboard to visually present the findings.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about students' scores in various subjects along with personal details such as gender. The following data points are included in the dataset:
- **Student ID**
- **Gender**
- **Grade Level**
- **Subject Scores** (Math, English, etc.)
- **Final Grades**
- **Outliers and missing data were handled to ensure accuracy and integrity.**

## Objectives
The project aimed to answer key questions about student performance:
- Who are the top-performing students?
- Which subjects do students excel in?
- How does gender influence average grades?
- Who achieved the highest overall scores?
- Is there a relationship between average grades and final scores?

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: The data was gathered, and any missing or duplicate entries were removed.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleansed to address missing values, duplicated rows, and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Key performance trends were identified, focusing on the top students and subject-wise performance.
4. **Data Visualization**: A comprehensive dashboard was created to provide visual insights into the data.
   - This includes charts and graphs for gender comparisons, subject performance, and overall student rankings.

## Key Findings
- Identification of top-performing students.
- Analysis of subjects where students performed exceptionally well.
- Insights into how gender impacts performance.
- Correlation between average and final grades.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides an interactive experience to explore the data insights. It includes:
- **Top Performers**: A list of students who excelled across subjects.
- **Subject Analysis**: Charts showing the performance of students in various subjects.
- **Gender Comparison**: Visualizations highlighting performance trends based on gender.
- **Grade Correlation**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between average and final grades.
